									do you have to do?</b> Patrick responded saying his industry is classified as "software" and that other kinds of work he is required
									to do involves "presentations at events, internal meetings, and lots of problem solving"</p>

									<h2>What kind of interactions happen?</h2>

									<p>Next up, Jack enquired as to <b>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work?</b> To which Patrick desrcibed
									that he works with "Microsoft customers and other businesses who work with Microsoft, called Microsoft partners", also mentioning
									that he works alot with "the Microsoft staff, locally and globally"</p>
									<p>Following up the mention of clients, Patrick was then asked <b>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</b>
									To which patrick describes that "clients can range from medium size to large Enterprise customers and i have dealt with a lot of them."
