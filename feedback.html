									<h2>What went well?</h2>
									<p><b>Harry Oliver -</b> One problem with the project that I joined late and we were late into starting to
									work together and getting communication up and running, however, what went well with this project was that
									once communication was established and everyone had access to the shared google doc we quickly began 
									completing work. I wrote outlines of each segment of the assignment that needed completed with briefs of 
									what needs to be contained and each member was extremely quick to fill out the blanks and completely 
									satisfied with the amount of writing I thought was appropriate. While we struggled to get rolling the 
									work ethic of each group member quickly alleviate this issue.</p>
									
									<p><b>Conelio -</b> We jumped on board after a few wobblies and we hit it hard and everyone understood 
									the job at hand that needed to be done and it was done. The setting up was done quickly and efficiently
									and and thanks to Harry who put the framework together and it was easier to fill in the gaps. There was
									peace in the group and respect and it was actually pleasant to work with this mob even though we did not
									see each other physically.</p>
									
									<p><b>Jack Lockhart -</b> Overall I think the group managed rather well although we were all off to a
									late start which is understandable with people having different time frames for things they do in day 
									to day life although when it came together it did come together, I have felt getting an interview 
									straight away was very well timed on my behalf but also the fact that the group all added their own 
									part with either large writings or text boxes for each other’s large writings.</p>

									<h2>What could be improved?</h2>
									<p><b>Harry Oliver -</b> As previously mentioned there was an issue with beginning work on the project, 
									however, I believe it was mostly a circumstantial result of not having enough members then myself 
									joining a few weeks into the release of the assignment.</p>
									
									<p><b>Conelio -</b> The university should understand that there is a huge diversity in people‘s 
									lives in the course and trying to put something together and deal with the practicalities of life
									can be tricky, hence should give less assignments if there is group work that needs to be done.</p>
									
									<p><b>Jack Lockhart -</b> The way the team could have worked together if situations were different
									to output a more thorough document even though no matter how well a document is put together you can
									still always go better if better is the goal.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h2>One thing that was surprising?</h2>
									<p><b>Harry Oliver -</b> The most surprising thing was how quickly each group member picked up the
									slack from the lack of work at the early days of the assignment, we each put in a lot of work to 
									catch up and to hopefully have a finished product by the deadline.</p>
									
									<p><b>Conelio -</b> How quickly I learned from zero to  top notch in adapting to using technology
									and communications in a formal way and how effective it is to use this technology to achieve 
									something sweet like this. </p>
									
									<p><b>Jack Lockhart -</b> The way the people had very similar ideas but also at the same time 
									so different to each other which made it such a fun thing to learn about everyone else's ideas.
									The way they correlated together was awesome although mine was different im sure certain groups 
									also had similar ideas. </p>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h2>One thing you learned from the group?</h2>
									<p><b>Harry Oliver -</b> I believe that this group in particular has worked best with each of 
									us tackling different requirements of the assignment. Two examples being me decoding the
									assignment document and presenting what needed to be written down so that not every member had 
									to consult the document, and Jack Lockhart completing the interview segment of the assignment 
									completely independently which meant that no other group member had to worry about organising it.</p>
									
									<p><b>Conelio -</b> Sharing the workload made all things easier and achievable and less stressful.
									There was no sweaty and no heart palpitations at all and the nights were good to sleep without the
									mind racing as much.</p>
									
									<p><b>Jack Lockhart -</b> The different paths people are willing to take in careers as well as the
									skills they need to accomplish these goals but also the way other people use their skills and ideas
									to create different goals or project ideas.</p>
