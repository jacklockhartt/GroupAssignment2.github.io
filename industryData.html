										<h1>Industry Data</h1>

									</header>
									
									<p>In this segment the group discusses our reflections on the industry data provided by RMIT for this assignment
									and what it implicates for our concept of an 'ideal job'</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>What job title is your ideal job?</h2>

									<p><b>Harry Oliver -</b><i> Solutions Architect</i>: Considering the position requires the employee to have a vast
									array of skills and proficiencies in varying IT fields in order to solve problems, I think Solutions Architect is
									the most appropraite title. Tis title ranks as teh most desireable amongst employers</p>
									
									<p><b>Jack Lockhart -</b><i> Cyber Security Analyst</i>: This position requires teh ability to network, secure systems,
									plus find and fix any faults. This title is well represented and needed in all businesses within the modern age and
									any unique or growing large scale cloud service provider or users need a Cyber Security Analyst.</p>
									
									<p><b>Roberto Martinez -</b><i> Technical Architect</i>: This position requires analysing the requirements of large systems
									and breaking them down into manageable units also working with designers and developers to explain the structure work
									closely with them.</p>
									
									<p><b>Conelio Mafohla -</b><i> Software Developer</i>: This position requires software development from scratch to finish
									and requires knowledge and experience in PHP programming, LAMP/LEMP stack and good skills with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,
									jQuerry and AJAX and it ranks very highly in the industry and gets paid well. Ranks number 1 on Forbes and US News &
									World Report Magazine</p>

									<h2>How do the IT specific skills of your Ideal Job rank?</h2>

									<p><b>Harry Oliver -</b> The ideal job I listed in my first assignment underlined that I would have to be proficient in
									SQL (1), JAVA (3), Project Management (5), Software Engineering (15) and potentially more as the description mentions that
									a huge variety of problem types will need to be addressed. SQL and JAVA are both top 3 IT specific skills.</p>
									
									<p><b>Jack Lockhart -</b> My ideal job requires the ability to be efficent in JAVA (15), Python (3), Programming (1) but also
									a lot of general purpose background security platforms such as AlienVault (5) and others they are all specific to this role
									and very important to the employer searching for this role.</p>
									
									<p><b>Roberto Martinez -</b> My ideal job requires Programming languages JAVA (3), SQL (1), .NET, C++ but also Data communication
									networks (LANs, WANs, Intranets). Management would also play a role.</p>
									
									<p><b>Conelio Mafohla -</b> It requires knowledge and experience in PHP programming, LAMP/LEMP stack and good skills with HTML5, CSS3,
									JavaScript, jQuerry and AJAX. In addition, knowledge in integration and web design is a bonus.</p>
		
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>How do the general skills of your Ideal job rank?</h2>

									<p><b>Harry Oliver -</b> Regarding general employee skills, my ideal job requires a lot of communication and working with clients to
									tailor make software or database solutions, meaning that communication skills (1), problem solving (2), troubleshooting (6) and
									research (10) would be the most critical general skills.</p>
									
									<p><b>Jack Lockhart -</b> The main skills needed for my roles are communication (1), problem solving (10), intuition (2), maintenance (6)
									and the ability to keep up with the ever changing security platforms.</p>
									
									<p><b>Roberto Martinez -</b> My ideal job would require Communication (2), problem solving (4), troubleshooting and keeping up with 
									updated programs etc</p>
									
									<p><b>Conelio Mafohla -</b> The job expects good communication skills (1) and excellent problem solving skills (10) and goot team work (5)</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h2>What are the highest rank non-essential IT skills for your Ideal job?</h2>
									
									<p><b>Harry Oliver -</b> The top 3 IT-specific skills that I don't think are required for my ideal job would be Javascript (2), Microsoft
									Windows (4), and SAP (6). However, due to the robust nature of the job I wouldn't be surprised if these skills were also required by
									the employer, if not highly recommended</p>
									
									<p><b>Jack Lockhart -</b> The top 3 IT-specific skills that aren't required by my role but are probably more than essential within the
									basis of this role are Microsoft Document Programs (2), Hardware Installation (4) and Bootable Operating Systems (6).</p>
									
									<p><b>Roberto Martinez -</b> The top 3 IT-specific skills that are not required by my role but might be useful. Hardware Installation, Microsoft
									Windows and Mac Os.</p>
									
									<p><b>Conelio Mafohla -</b> 3 IT sspecific skills not required by my skill-set are knowledge in python, servers and hardware services</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h2>what are the highest rank non-essential general skills for your Ideal job?</h2>
									
									<p><b>Harry Oliver -</b> The top 3 non-IT specific skills that aren't listed by the employer as required would be Organisational skills (3),
									Writing (4), and Teamwork/Collaboration (5). However these are such essential skills to any IT job so I wouldn't imagine these are
									unnecessary rather they are so essential to the job that they aren't mentioned.</p>
									
									<p><b>Jack Lockhart -</b> Top 3 non-IT specific skills that are not essential for this specific role such as Prioritization (3), Proficiency (4)
									and Teamwork (5)</p>
									
									<p><b>Roberto Martinez -</b> Top 3 non-IT specific skills that are not essential Writing, teamwork, and prioritization but could help at the workplace</p>
									
									<p><b>Conelio Mafohla -</b> Top general skills not required skill-set include communication and time manageent though it's hard to see why
									they are not listed as they are critical</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h2>Has your ideal job choice changed?</h2>
									
									<p><b>Harry Oliver -</b> My ideal job choice hasn't changed, after consulting the data I have more of a conviction to follow through with attaining
									the job as it appears that all the skills required for such a position are highly desirable and would prepare me for any other IT job as well.</p>
									
									<p><b>Jack Lockhart -</b> The focus of my ain goal hasn't changed whatsoever after reading the burning glass data the focus is still the same role
									within the same field with the exact same dedication and focus as I had prior to reading the burning glass document.</p>
									
									<p><b>Roberto Martinez -</b> My ideal job has changed many times as more information moves forward. Reading the burning glass data just makes me
									feel more secure that my ideal could prepare me for other related jobs</p>
									
									<p><b>Conelio Mafohla -</b> It does not change my ideal ob but it is scary seeing the rapidness at which changes are hapening, am I going
									to be redudant by the time the course is finished.</p>
