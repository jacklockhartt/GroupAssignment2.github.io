										<h1>Project Idea</h1>

									</header>
									
									<p>The project idea that the group voted on was Harry Oliver’s idea which is extremely similar to
									the idea presented by Roberto, the fact that two team members had coincidentally developed very 
									similar ideas is very beneficial to the vision of the project as it allows the two members to 
									contribute their own ideas for their projects towards one group project. Additionally the two 
									other members provide an outsider perspective of the idea as it develops and can provide an objective
									opinion on the design choices we make. A brief of the project idea is as follows:The project idea 
									was a mobile application which would organise and present political parties policies during an
									election cycle. The purpose of the application would be to clearly present each individual policy 
									idea put forward by major political parties on the key issues, following this presentation would be
									an expert analysis to verify the validity of the policy suggestions as well as to present what the
									effects of such a policy would be. The only alternative to this concept that I know of is the
									Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s collaboration with RMIT University in its program called 
									‘Fact Check’ but this segment is nowhere near as fleshed out and developed as it should be.</p>
									<p>This project was developed from the understanding of the growing use of misinformation in election 
									cycles and my desire to preserve Australian democracy to prevent it from corrupting like so many
									others. Roberto’s contribution differed in that it would have a social media function within the 
									app where users could present to other users how the policy would affect them, this would allow 
									for voters to be able to sympathise with those who would be negatively/positively affected by
									policy, i.e. if a bill sought to reduce the weekly pension amount its easier for younger voters
									to be unsympathetic towards the elderly but seeing a real human express how much more difficult
									the loss of income would be allows voters to make decisions that benefit others as well as themselves.
