									<h2>Cybersecurity (Harry Oliver)</h2>
									<h3>What does it do?</h3>
									<p>In essence Cybersecurity is the protection of data, information systems, networks and many other elements of 
									IT, it is arguably the most important aspect of IT and programming in this modern era of cyber warfare between 
									countries and the theft of individuals and businesses sensitive information. Cybersecurity is a general term for 
									IT processes which are undertaken to minimise the chance for compromisation of IT systems or of data communication.
									The state of the art technology regarding cybersecurity would fall under two distinct types of security, physical
									and digital. Physical security is usually overlooked in terms of cybersecurity but it is just as critical in
									maximising the effectiveness of digital cybersecurity. While digital security is continually being improved,
									physical cybersecurity can only improve so much (within reason), the pinnacle being the use of different physical 
									barriers such as: guards, locked doors, biometric/facial readers (part digital part physical), reinforced building,
									security surveillance, restrictions of access, isolated location, etc. Conversely regarding digital security, 
									according to ECPI University [1] some of the most current digital cybersecurity methods include: Next Generation 
									Breach Detection, Virtual Dispersive Networking, and Context-Aware Behavioral Analytics. Next Generation Breach 
									Detection involves the combination of machine learning and behavioral analytics to be utilised to detect dormant
									hacker access and covert manipulation within a system, simply put it is an automated system which analyses the 
									behavior of devices within a network and can categorise potentially hostile behavior patterns and identify the 
									device(s) which it belongs. Virtual Dispersive Networking is essentially the splitting up of transmitted data
									into separate segments which are each encrypted individually, this makes the role of an interceptive hacker much
									more difficult as not only do multiple segments of data need to be successfully intercepted but they each also 
									need decrypted. Finally Context-Aware Behavioral Analysis is a methodology of identifying suspicious activity 
									that involves reducing the number of false reports that a system administrator would receive. By narrowing down
									the number of reports the system owners would have a much easier time located and dealing with a suspicious 
									activity. In the following 3 years I believe that more intense encryption and the involvement of more machine 
									learning algorithms will be deployed to help in securing data transmissions and in identifying breaches in a
									system respectively. Both of these continued advancements are heavily dependent on the speed in which systems
									are able to encrypt and decrypt data, the quicker systems can communicate means that the more complicated the
									level of encryption is possible.</p>
									
									<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
									<p>The likely impact of these advancements in cybersecurity would act to further secure IT systems from 
									breach and data communications from interception, making it universally harder for hackers to access systems 
									and to steal communicated data as the more complex and nuanced the encryption systems the equally as complicated 
									decryption is required. As with all other advancements in cybersecurity the outcome is generally a reduction 
									in successful attacks on systems/data. The more advanced the cybersecurity methods become the more qualified 
									the architects of these systems would have to be, otherwise it would involve having more employees dedicated 
									to different aspects of establishing the cybersecurity meaning more than likely jobs will be created.
									Additionally, with any advancement in such a field, jobs specialising in compromising and breaching such
									systems would also increase as countries would move to hire more hackers to aid in compromising the cyber 
									defences of enemy countries. </p>
									
									<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
									<p>While I have never personally been a victim of a cyber attack the improvements in cybersecurity would help
									ensure such an attack would never happen, the protection of online services exchanging my information with my 
									devices and my device communicating with my bank are two examples of communications that will better protected
									by any advancements in cybersecurity. The same way my personal information will be more secure, the same benefits 
									will impact my family or friends. Ultimately the most beneficial party from such advancements are businesses, as
									businesses small and large both experience alarmingly high amounts of cyber attacks which cost them huge amounts
									of time (through IT systems being brought down) and money (many avenues of abusing sensitive information acquired 
									from hacking).</p>
									
									<h2>Machine Learning (Conelio)</h2>
									<h3>What does it do?</h3>
									<p>Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence where computer software or application use data to
									identify patterns and make decisions on their own or with very little help from human beings. This starts by the 
									application observing patterns in a given data and then automatically make better decisions without human intervention.
									This learning can be supervised which means an inference or prediction can be made from a known starting point
									(apply what is known now to new data and predict future results). In unsupervised learning the application makes 
									conclusions rightly or wrong by exploring the data that is random. In between the above learning methods,
									is a mixture of the two called semi-supervised learning which is a bit of both in various proportions. Machine
									learning can also be achieved through reinforcement learning which involves getting the best results through 
									trial and error and rewarding the best solution. The future with  machine learning is brighter and will be an 
									integral part of all artificial intelligence systems as it becomes critical in business applications. It is also
									probable that it will be offered as a cloud-based service. As a result of this exploitation hardware manufactures 
									will called upon to redesign their machines so that the can power machine learning software. Machine learning will
									continue to learn as more information and  traffic increases on the internet.</p>
									
									<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
									<p>Machine learning allows rapid analyzation of gigantic data enabling humans to solve  complex problems faster and
									accurately. By so doing business can discover opportunities to profit and expand as well as uncover and avoid risks. 
									Groups or companies working with large volumes of data are appreciating the value of machine learning as they are 
									able to operate more efficiently. These include financial services to detect fraud, health care services to improve
									citizens’ health through wearable devices, and retail shops to analyze shoppers’ buying habits. While machine
									learning advances the human race it demands more time and resources  for it to be trained properly. However if 
									combined with other forms of artificial intelligence and cognitive applications it  can become more effective.  
									Rather than have anxiety over job losses,  machine learning should take over boring jobs that human beings do not 
									want to do so that humans can apply more time to higher level  jobs. Instead the focus should be on the redesign of
									jobs. Some of the jobs that are threatened with the advancement of machine learning include credit authorizers,
									funeral directors, brokerage clerks. On the other hand jobs such as massage therapists and animal scientist will remain.</p>
									
									<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
									<p>Machine learning will enrich and elevate life in various ways. Having relations living in abject poverty and
									disease ridden continents machine learning will help eliminate disease through prevention, proper and accurate
									diagnosis as well as through powerful treatments. Poverty will be eliminated by identifying where help is mostly
									needed by analyzing data from satellite images. By introducing machine learning some of my relations can have their
									jobs replaced so that they can pursue careers that are more meaningful to them. I work as a massage therapist and I
									am certain my job is intact, this is one of the jobs that humans will always do.</p>
									
									<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
									
									<h3>What does it do?</h3>
									<p>Autonomous vehicles are the way of the future they are known as a robotic, self-driving or driverless car that can drive itself using the environment with sensors using little or no human input. Autonomous vehicles are self-governing so they control their position on the road and they way they move with other traffic, surrounding environments or any moving object that could potentially be a danger to that car or mainly the passengers inside it.
There are major inconsistencies within the vocabulary of self-driving cars this is why the definition of them isn’t exactly easy to come across or explain completely in detail in up to date terminology these modern vehicles have general capabilities they can stay within their lane, observer other cars positions and brake when needed to this makes them useful but how safe are they is the question I ask myself.
Most of these modern day automated cars are only partially automatic with some human interaction needed but with the likes of all the major tech giants investing in automated cars this is only a temporary thing with the likes of Microsoft, Apple, Google, Tesla & all countries around the world investing into the safety of such projects with potential to be output on a large scale within the next few years to the higher income earners and then slowly making their way down to the middle class from my expectation within 20 years but this is the case of completely autonomous not partially autonomous.
The main difference between autonomous and automated is that automated provides heavily on external aid with that aid either being from an external force such a guiding, magnetic strips or some sort of force to somewhat control or guide the position of that object. Autonomous provides significant satisfactory performance under unforeseeable circumstances in the environment and the ability to work out systems failures without external intervention.
There is a big misunderstanding between the way in which autonomous and automated work which has led to a lot of unforeseen deaths being that one can hold its position and break but it isn’t completely driverless so their can be situations when people misinterpret this and end up in a deadly situation that can cause fatalities.
The best way to describe how these changes have became possible is to look back at the tech giants from either the car tech giant or simply just the tech giants with both helping in one way or another to make this possible I feel as though the idea of self-driving cars has always been around but the commencement of these projects may have been around the same time google maps started mapping the world with the cameras they needed even though mainly using satellites and other aerial technology to get these images the cars that they did have in dense urban environments were covered in sensors and cameras of all types.
There onwards or even before hand small developments may have been taking place but the way they have grown in recent years is beyond the past years of development putting these ideas into reality on the roads with other cars is a thing of the present but with the technology only being tested it still has a way to go before it is completely safe especially with other drivers on the road with the way cars move and all other aspects that go into making a self-driving car safe for the driver, passenger and all other road users. Only time will tell how far these cars will progress with them taking away the functionality of driving your own car but also providing a lot more function at the same time I think it is going to be a very personal preference thing is a very long time.
 </p>
									<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
									<p>The impact of these Autonomous and automated vehicles is completely up to how they are designed with the safety dangers being one of the likely impacts but more then that they may not be wanted in general other then by the higher wage earner or the person who likes to stay up late and get up early for a long drive but this also completely takes the fun away from driving a car with day to day work life of a normal person sometimes commuting can be a relaxing part of the day even in condensed traffic areas giving you that extra wakeup call either listening to the radio or drinking a coffee while changing gears and switching lanes it isn’t necessarily a wakeup call but it is definitely part of the experience that a lot of people do enjoy.  This won’t affect a lot of people for a very long time to come but driving down the highway passing autonomous cars is definitely a thing of the future but the dangers of such things are what people will do while the car is driving itself is it safe to put a location 8 hours away in the GPS then fall asleep behind the wheel and only get woken for fuel or once you’ve arrived at your destination. Does this create poor habits for the owners of these cars, or does it create better ones? The amount of questions that go left unanswered on this topic are endless but will be answered in time.  The production of these car may create some jobs, but I feel as though they will be filtered into the car industry similar to high class sports cars and that’s all they will be for a long time. The focus currently is advancing these technologies for these cars.
 </p>
									<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
									<p>The use of autonomous cars will not affect me personally within my day to day life as the use of these cars are a thing of the future they aren’t something I will be dealing with or using for a very long time nor would I expect to see large amounts of them on the road for a very long time as they are expensive and very underdeveloped they probably won’t have a major effect on my family or friends in the near future but they are becoming something that you will see a lot more of especially in suburban areas.
They will drive themselves in the future leaving passengers nothing to do other then catch up on some well-earned rest or watch some sort of entertainment either on their route to any location they are directed in the way these systems work will help people get more things done so I can’t see this affecting many people.
I can’t see them affected me in the foreseeable future although they may affect the way people operate with other traffic and not having my family or friends owning one of these makes the pro’s and con’s really hard to define other then a few tesla videos here and their the pro’s and con’s aren’t something that can just be defined I think they have their very own special place in the car world no matter how it affects me or other people they are definitely a thing of the future which can’t be changed only developed more to operate better and coexist as part of an ever changing world.
There will be accidents, mistakes and other failures of these systems the same as any other system but they will be overcome, solved or worked with to be fixed under any circumstance.

									<h2>Cryptocurrency and Blockchain</h2>
									<h3>What does it do?</h3>
									<p>The new blockchain and cryptocurrency trend has been booming in recent years with the blockchain being created which is basically a stock exchange for the cryptocurrencies but it can also be used to store your own personal cryptocurrencies if you trade or in them or invested in them in the earlier years of them beginning. The original Cryptocurrency was Bitcoin since then Litecoin and many others have come into circulation.
I will start off by giving a run down on the on blockchain as a whole it is basically a transaction database so all information on these currencies current prices are shown here as it is a transaction facility but it stores every single transaction ever recorded on its records as it is the basis for the currency although this is different from a centralized bank as all transaction records are completely anonymous.
Blockchain stores dates, times, amounts and other completely anonymous information on every transaction that has ever existed. Blocks store information that separates them from other blocks. Blockchain has facilitated the rise of digital currency this rise has created so many options for online currencies to grow and expand.
Currently cryptocurrencies can be used for so many different things from fund storage, investment, online purchases and basically everything even standard money systems can be accepted if the shopkeeper or user accepts cryptocurrencies.
In the next 3 years all large businesses should be using cryptocurrencies they should be using them to make purchases, invest and expand all types of enterprises.
Smart contracts are highly powerful application block chain technology they can be used for all types of things. These contracts are actual computer programs that oversee the agreement at hand these are very useful for all business transactions they are suited to large businesses.
The more these contracts expand the better they become within a few years everyone will be using these contracts so the future of big business will be based around these contracts everyone that uses big business will use these.
Within the next few years these transaction will become more efficient with even government agencies looking into using these transactions for large scale plans and developments or government proposals the future of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies has a very exciting future with all the plans that have been put in place to expand or grow the main chain itself but also with the government plans to use and trade within this currency in the near future the growth is limitless.
Cryptocurrencies use cryptology which is a very advanced technology that keeps the cryptocurrencies safe and secure with every transaction they go through with big changes expected to come to the crypto world with institutional money being input into the system the possibilities are endless.
The currency is also decentralized and uses peer to peer technology with the potential growth of these currencies expected to grow within the next few years but the amount of growth is debatable especially putting the time frame within the next 3 years as we have for this question but you could expect to see the rise of cryptocurrencies raise to well over 5 – 10 trillion dollars as a whole within the next 5 years with that almost tripling within the next 9 years. With currency stations providing Bitcoin, Litecoin and all the other currencies in exchange for actual institutional dollars this growth may never end. This is what makes these two things an amazing thought for the future.
 </p>
									<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
									<p> The impact of this expanse of growth within the cryptocurrency and blockchain market leaves the impact of future transactions within its grasp, future currencies and future businesses with all three of these being taken into consideration the only way to prepare for this change or understand the impact is to think of if you would be interested in making the change to this currency with online purchases if so then you would have to come to terms with the fact that is a different process to just grabbing a card out of your wallet and throwing down the details but it is a lot more secure but with that being said the future of bitcoin may being headed towards cards with set amount cards being available to use such as a pre-purchased visa or even general crypto visa cards that can either be used a credit or directly hooked to your wallet although these are not seen often they are becoming a thing of the future.
The older generation make be affected by these changes with the fact that coming to terms with a new currency may be a little overwhelming like learning a new addition system or language system. This paired with the fact that having multiple ways to pay gives you multiple ways to spend not always being the best option in certain cases but is certainly a way of the future. This may create some jobs to help the expanse of this currency with potential small banks being opened to help circulate the movement of this currency but also larger ones either online or offline no loss of jobs would come from this transaction as it is a completely new currency which may be expanding but certainly will not replace our current money system within any foreseeable time.
</p>
									<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
									<p>The personal effects of this transition will not affect me at all but it may in the future with these currencies being a thing that you can invest in, trade in my purchases in the future may swing me to look into something like cryptocurrencies the difference for me would be the transaction from institutional money to crypto for small transactions as I could see it being more costly then affordable seeing as the fact that these transactions have a surcharge on them similar to your visa card when you spend less than 10 dollars and you get hit with a small surcharge that will be used for crypto as well although this surcharge may be much larger than with your general visa card.
My family and friends may be affected by this change in the same way I would make it I wouldn’t say difficult but a more expensive task when purchasing small items this wouldn’t be the case with larger purchases as once past a certain point the surcharge may minimize. Personally this change is beneficial to the smart spender that likes multiple ways to pay for certain things leaving all options on the table but also adding another from the general ways to pay as some people like to use different ways to pay for different things they purchase it is really personal preference and the benefit you get from purchasing that product that way.
These changes won’t go unnoticed and they definitely won’t be a challenge to get into it will be the exact same as using a local bank or any other financial institution such as Zip Money or any other online purchasing system with these giving you a delayed way to pay this gives you another way to pay.
Thanks for taking the time to read my run down on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
