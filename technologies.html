									<h2>Cybersecurity (Harry Oliver)</h2>
									<h3>What does it do?</h3>
									<p>In essence Cybersecurity is the protection of data, information systems, networks and many other elements of 
									IT, it is arguably the most important aspect of IT and programming in this modern era of cyber warfare between 
									countries and the theft of individuals and businesses sensitive information. Cybersecurity is a general term for 
									IT processes which are undertaken to minimise the chance for compromisation of IT systems or of data communication.
									The state of the art technology regarding cybersecurity would fall under two distinct types of security, physical
									and digital. Physical security is usually overlooked in terms of cybersecurity but it is just as critical in
									maximising the effectiveness of digital cybersecurity. While digital security is continually being improved,
									physical cybersecurity can only improve so much (within reason), the pinnacle being the use of different physical 
									barriers such as: guards, locked doors, biometric/facial readers (part digital part physical), reinforced building,
									security surveillance, restrictions of access, isolated location, etc. Conversely regarding digital security, 
									according to ECPI University [1] some of the most current digital cybersecurity methods include: Next Generation 
									Breach Detection, Virtual Dispersive Networking, and Context-Aware Behavioral Analytics. Next Generation Breach 
									Detection involves the combination of machine learning and behavioral analytics to be utilised to detect dormant
									hacker access and covert manipulation within a system, simply put it is an automated system which analyses the 
									behavior of devices within a network and can categorise potentially hostile behavior patterns and identify the 
									device(s) which it belongs. Virtual Dispersive Networking is essentially the splitting up of transmitted data
									into separate segments which are each encrypted individually, this makes the role of an interceptive hacker much
									more difficult as not only do multiple segments of data need to be successfully intercepted but they each also 
									need decrypted. Finally Context-Aware Behavioral Analysis is a methodology of identifying suspicious activity 
									that involves reducing the number of false reports that a system administrator would receive. By narrowing down
									the number of reports the system owners would have a much easier time located and dealing with a suspicious 
									activity. In the following 3 years I believe that more intense encryption and the involvement of more machine 
									learning algorithms will be deployed to help in securing data transmissions and in identifying breaches in a
									system respectively. Both of these continued advancements are heavily dependent on the speed in which systems
									are able to encrypt and decrypt data, the quicker systems can communicate means that the more complicated the
									level of encryption is possible.</p>
									
									<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
									<p>The likely impact of these advancements in cybersecurity would act to further secure IT systems from 
									breach and data communications from interception, making it universally harder for hackers to access systems 
									and to steal communicated data as the more complex and nuanced the encryption systems the equally as complicated 
									decryption is required. As with all other advancements in cybersecurity the outcome is generally a reduction 
									in successful attacks on systems/data. The more advanced the cybersecurity methods become the more qualified 
									the architects of these systems would have to be, otherwise it would involve having more employees dedicated 
									to different aspects of establishing the cybersecurity meaning more than likely jobs will be created.
									Additionally, with any advancement in such a field, jobs specialising in compromising and breaching such
									systems would also increase as countries would move to hire more hackers to aid in compromising the cyber 
									defences of enemy countries. </p>
									
									<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
									<p>While I have never personally been a victim of a cyber attack the improvements in cybersecurity would help
									ensure such an attack would never happen, the protection of online services exchanging my information with my 
									devices and my device communicating with my bank are two examples of communications that will better protected
									by any advancements in cybersecurity. The same way my personal information will be more secure, the same benefits 
									will impact my family or friends. Ultimately the most beneficial party from such advancements are businesses, as
									businesses small and large both experience alarmingly high amounts of cyber attacks which cost them huge amounts
									of time (through IT systems being brought down) and money (many avenues of abusing sensitive information acquired 
									from hacking).</p>
									
									<h2>Machine Learning (Conelio)</h2>
									<h3>What does it do?</h3>
									<p>Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence where computer software or application use data to
									identify patterns and make decisions on their own or with very little help from human beings. This starts by the 
									application observing patterns in a given data and then automatically make better decisions without human intervention.
									This learning can be supervised which means an inference or prediction can be made from a known starting point
									(apply what is known now to new data and predict future results). In unsupervised learning the application makes 
									conclusions rightly or wrong by exploring the data that is random. In between the above learning methods,
									is a mixture of the two called semi-supervised learning which is a bit of both in various proportions. Machine
									learning can also be achieved through reinforcement learning which involves getting the best results through 
									trial and error and rewarding the best solution. The future with  machine learning is brighter and will be an 
									integral part of all artificial intelligence systems as it becomes critical in business applications. It is also
									probable that it will be offered as a cloud-based service. As a result of this exploitation hardware manufactures 
									will called upon to redesign their machines so that the can power machine learning software. Machine learning will
									continue to learn as more information and  traffic increases on the internet.</p>
									
									<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
									<p>Machine learning allows rapid analyzation of gigantic data enabling humans to solve  complex problems faster and
									accurately. By so doing business can discover opportunities to profit and expand as well as uncover and avoid risks. 
									Groups or companies working with large volumes of data are appreciating the value of machine learning as they are 
									able to operate more efficiently. These include financial services to detect fraud, health care services to improve
									citizens’ health through wearable devices, and retail shops to analyze shoppers’ buying habits. While machine
									learning advances the human race it demands more time and resources  for it to be trained properly. However if 
									combined with other forms of artificial intelligence and cognitive applications it  can become more effective.  
									Rather than have anxiety over job losses,  machine learning should take over boring jobs that human beings do not 
									want to do so that humans can apply more time to higher level  jobs. Instead the focus should be on the redesign of
									jobs. Some of the jobs that are threatened with the advancement of machine learning include credit authorizers,
									funeral directors, brokerage clerks. On the other hand jobs such as massage therapists and animal scientist will remain.</p>
									
									<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
									<p>Machine learning will enrich and elevate life in various ways. Having relations living in abject poverty and
									disease ridden continents machine learning will help eliminate disease through prevention, proper and accurate
									diagnosis as well as through powerful treatments. Poverty will be eliminated by identifying where help is mostly
									needed by analyzing data from satellite images. By introducing machine learning some of my relations can have their
									jobs replaced so that they can pursue careers that are more meaningful to them. I work as a massage therapist and I
									am certain my job is intact, this is one of the jobs that humans will always do.</p>
